# Portfolio V3

My personal portfolio website built with Next.js 15, showcasing my projects, skills, and experience. I've designed it to be a modern, responsive, and user-friendly platform that highlights my work and capabilities.
This version is a complete rewrite of my previous portfolio, with a focus on performance and user experience. It features a clean and modern design, with smooth animations and a responsive layout that works well on all devices.

This project also holds storage for my personal projects. I have a PostgreSQL database connected to the app, which allows me to store and manage my projects efficiently. The database is set up using Prisma, a powerful ORM that simplifies database interactions.

The aim of this project is to use all my knowledge and skills to create a website that covers most of the work developers do. I want it to show what I am capable of and what I can do for others. I also want to use this project to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
